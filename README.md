# AI_Python-5th-sem-
This repository contains Python implementations of Artificial Intelligence lab experiments that I learned and practiced during my 5th semester as part of the CSE (Data Science) curriculum. It includes fundamental AI concepts such as search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, AO*), heuristic problem solving, logical reasoning, and game-playing strategies.
