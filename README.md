## About This Repository

This repository contains the **Artificial Intelligence Lab programs (22CDL54)** that **I learned and implemented during my 5th semester** as part of the **CSE (Data Science)** curriculum at **Bellari Institute of Technology & Management**.

All the programs in this repository were written and practiced by me while learning:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Core Artificial Intelligence concepts
- Search algorithms, reasoning techniques, and game strategies

This repository reflects my **hands-on learning and understanding of AI concepts** during the 5th semester.
